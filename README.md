# indefinite-su-representations
A simple command line Java program that locates irreducible representations of SU(n,1).

The algorithms that locate constituents of the irreducible dual of SU(n,1) are found in two papers by Hrvoje Kraljević. The first is his 1973 paper "Representations of the Universal Covering Group of the Group SU(n,1)" (Glasniki Mathematiki 8 (28), 1), which is the work from which the algorithms are derived. The second is his 1976 AMS Transactions paper "On Representations of the Group SU(n,1)", which features many of the formulas that appear in the code. Accordingly, references to "Kraljevic" in comments in the code refer to the 1976 paper.
